# Eniac_Discount_Project

## Summary 
   The Eniac Discount Project focuses on analyzing discount strategies and their impact on sales performance. 
   By leveraging data-driven insights, the project aims to optimize discount offers and improve revenue generation.

## Languages and libraries used 
   - Python: Used for data manipulation, analysis, and processing.
   - Pandas: Employed for data cleaning, quality check, and exploration.
   - Seaborn: Used for statistical data visualization.
   - Matplotlib: Used for data visualization.
   - Google slide: for presentation and reporting.

## Key learnings
   - Python as a Primary Tool: Python, along with Pandas, was the primary tool for cleaning, processing, and analyzing the data to gain insights into discount strategies.
   - Visualization for Insight: Seaborn and Matplotlib were instrumental in visualizing discount impacts and trends to make data-driven decisions.
   - Recommendations were made to the CEO of Eniac to optimize discount strategies.
     For future research, we recommend exploring customer behavior, product categories, and external factors like marketing, competitor pricing, and holidays using time-series modeling
     to better understand sales dynamics and gain deeper insights to optimize discount strategies. A longer observation period would help us to make better statements.

## Challenges overcome 
   - Data Preprocessing: Cleaning large datasets with missing or inconsistent data was challenging. Pandas was used to handle missing data and outliers, ensuring analysis accuracy.
   - Visualization Complexity: Creating complex visualizations in Seaborn and Matplotlib required a learning curve. Practice and exploring different visualization techniques improved efficiency.
   - Team Collaboration: Effective teamwork played a crucial role in understanding the business questions and guiding the analysis towards actionable insights.

## Additional 
   Comparative Analysis: If more time were available, comparing different discount strategies across multiple product categories or geographic regions could provide further insights into optimizing discount offers.
